# How do compilers work?

> Computers speak only 1s and 0s

Yeah... We've all heard that sentence at least once, but have you ever wondered how computers actually read and execute your code?<br>
In this article we are going to take a look at how compilers work.

## What is a compiler?

But first of all, what is a compiler?<br>
A compiler is just a program, that takes the *source code* as input, and return an executable as output.

## Lexing

The first phase of the compilation is **lexing**.<br>
The **lexer** will take all the source code, and convert it into a stream of abstract unities that our computer can understand, we generally call these **tokens**.<br>
A token generally holds a *type* and a *value*.

But let's make an example:
```js
var a = 4 + 5
```
will be converted to:
```
[VAR, IDENTIFIER:"a", EQUAL, INT:"4", PLUS, INT:"5"]
```

Perfect! Now that we have our  **tokens**, we can pass to the next phase.

## Parsing

The job of the **parser** or the **syntax analyzer** is to analyze the tokens and generate an **Abstract Syntax Tree** (**AST**).<br>
A data structure that describes the structure of our program and, for example, can be used to evaluate expressions.

For example, the **AST** generated from this expression:
```
4 + 5 / 2 - 7
```
will be this:
```
    +
   / \
  /   \
 4     -
      / \
     /   \
    รท     7
   / \   
  /   \
 5     2
```

The **parses** tries match some predefined patterns, that are usually described in the grammar of our language.<br>
We won't dive into this topic, but if you're interested [this]() is a great article.

But what if the tokens don't match the grammar?<br>
Well...  We get a `SyntaxError`.

### Types of Parsing
Parsers follow production rules defined by means of context-free grammar. 
The way the production rules are implemented (derivation) divides parsing into two types : top-down parsing and bottom-up parsing.

#### Top-Down Parsing
When the parser starts constructing the parse tree from the start symbol and then tries to transform the start symbol to the input, it is called top-down parsing.

#### Recursive descent pairing
It is a common form of top-down parsing. 
It is called recursive as it uses recursive procedures to process the input. 
Recursive descent parsing suffers from backtracking.

#### Backtracking
It means, if one derivation of a production fails, the parser restarts the process using different rules of same production. 
This technique may process the input string more than once to determine the right production.

#### Bottom-Up Parsing
As the name suggests, bottom-up parsing starts with the input symbols and tries to construct the parse tree up to the start symbol.


## Compiling

Probably the most important part.<br>
Now that we have our **AST** we can *walk* through it and generate equivalent Assembly code.<br>
An interpreter works pretty much the same, but instead, it directly executes the code.

## Thanks for the attention

We got to the end... Now all that remains is to execute the code generated by our compiler and that's it!

Happy debugging,<br>
